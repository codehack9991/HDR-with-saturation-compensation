# HDR-with-saturation-compensation
A Novel Method to generate HDR images using ILP (Inverted Local Patterns) with its saturation compensation

## Setup
Our code is written in MATLAB 2018

## Usage
Copy the code to the path where you have the test images. After running the code, it automatically saves the resultinh HDR image at that same path as that of the code.

We also have provided sample test images in the images folder.
The resulting images of these sample images is also provided.

## End to End prototype

We will add a working user-friendly software soon.
